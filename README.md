_νύξ, νύκτες - the night_

an astrology program using NASA data to create pinpoint-precision horoscopes and guidance

this program is **abandoned** as of February 5th, 2023. this status extends two weeks into the future, as I can't work on it constantly.

this is an incomplete tool to:
- [+] automate queries to the JPL's Horizons system to fetch the observed ecliptic longitudes
of astrological bodies for any given date and time
- [-] calculate aspects accurate to the minute
- [-] generate personalised horoscopes and advice for any given time

this program is currently built in Python exclusively and uses the `urllib3` library.
the in-development edition uses the `progress` library.

*__please__ feel free to fork or add to this project! as well as test it, wring it, bend it in and out of shape, and let me know if you find any issues or want to resolve one!*
